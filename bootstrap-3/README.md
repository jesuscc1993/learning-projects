# bootstrap-3-demo
Dummy landing page to put to test what I've learned so far about Bootstrap 3.

## Getting Started
The project relies on many dependencies that need to be installed in order for the application to run.
In order to do so, please navigate to the project root folder and follow the steps below:

### Install dependencies
In order to install the project dependencies execute the following command (requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) to be installed):
```
npm install
```

### Run the application
In order to execute the application execute the following command:
```
http-server
```

## Live version
There is a [live version](https://jesuscc1993.github.io/bootstrap-3-demo/) available for a branch created from the latest commit before AngularJS was introduced.
This branch can still be found [here](https://github.com/jesuscc1993/bootstrap-3-demo/tree/angular-free-version) but will no longer be updated.

There is no live version for the AngularJS application as gh-pages seems to have issues dealing with it.
