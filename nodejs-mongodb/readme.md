# Express (node.js) + Mongoose (MongoDB) demo application

##Â About
This project exposes a series of endpoints procuring data management and analysis on noise registrations with auxiliary optional locations to be used as proxies for the noises' origin location.

## Technologies

The project uses [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to setup a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) server and [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) to handle data management with [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).

Libraries such as [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) and [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) have been incorporated mostly to facilitate data iteration and dates handling respectively.

[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) has been used instead of plain JS in order to facilitate a more defined and structured code that can easily highlight errors in the source code rather than at runtime.

## Installation

### With docker

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com)
3. Run the following commands:

```
npm i
docker pull mongo
```

### Without docker

1. Install [node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
2. Install [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
3. Run the following command:

```
npm i
```

## Configuration

Edit file src/app.settings.ts with your custom settings:

- `listeningPort` Port node.js will listen at for connections.
- `loggingEnabled` Defines whether logs will be outputted to the terminal. Errors will always be outputted.
- `connectionSettings.url` Url to use for the MongoDB database connection.
- `connectionSettings.databaseName` Name of the database to be used.
- `maximumSearchDistance` Maximum distance to the provided filter coordinates for results to be included.

## Run

1. Start your MongoDB daemon
2. Run `npm start` on a terminal to start the server.

## Utility commands

- `npm run start-mongodb` runs a local MongoDB daemon (Unix-based OS only).
- `npm run start-docker-db` starts a MongoDB container with the default settings.
- `npm run stop-docker-db` stops any MongoDB container started with the default settings.
